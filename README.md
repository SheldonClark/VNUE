# VNUE

VNUE App summary:


VNUE is a communications app focused on improving the process of musical acts contacting local
venues to book shows, as well as contacting other bands in your area. Current methods of contact
between musical acts and live music venues are archaic and disorganized - an area of communication which
desperately needs innovation. The main focus of VNUE is simplifying communication, as well as simplifying
the method for show runners to find local acts that match their criteria.

Rather than having to create your own means of communication via text messaging, Facebook, email,
twitter etc., VNUE offers a simpler solution: having all of your information, music and links on
one portfolio page, ready to send when you're ready to send.
